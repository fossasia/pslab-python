This repository hosts the python library for communicating with PSLab. This can be installed on a linux pc/raspberry pi. With this, one can communicate with the hardware using simple python code. 


* The project is inspired from ExpEYES  http://expeyes.in
* FOSSASIA is supporting development and promotion of ExpEYES project since 2014 mainly through Google Summer of Code
* The current work is a part of my GSoC-16 project

* python 2.6, 2.7, or 3.x
* NumPy, Scipy
* pyqt4-dev-tools         &nbsp;   #for pyuic4
* Pyqtgraph               &nbsp;  #Plotting library
* pyopengl and qt-opengl  &nbsp;   #for 3D graphics
* iPython-qtconsole       &nbsp;   #optional


#####Now clone both the repositories [pslab-apps](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-apps)  and [pslab](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab).


#####The following libraries must be installed

1. pslab-apps
2. pslab

*If user is only interested in using PSLab as an acquisition device without a display/GUI, only one repository  [pslab](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab) needs to be installed*


#####To install, cd into the directories

`$ cd <SOURCE_DIR>`

and run the following (for both the repos)

`$ sudo make clean`
