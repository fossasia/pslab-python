class HCSR04:
    """Read data from ultrasonic distance sensor HC-SR04/HC-SR05.

    These sensors can measure distances between 2 cm to 4 m (SR04) / 4.5 m
    (SR05).

    Sensors must have separate trigger and echo pins. First a 10 µs pulse is
    output on the trigger pin. The trigger pin must be connected to the TRIG
    pin on the sensor prior to use.

    Upon receiving this pulse, the sensor emits a sequence of sound pulses, and
    the logic level of its echo pin is also set high.  The logic level goes LOW
    when the sound packet returns to the sensor, or when a timeout occurs.
    Timeout occurs if no echo is received within the time slot determinded by
    the sensor's maximum range.

    The ultrasound sensor outputs a series of eight sound pulses at 40 kHz,
    which corresponds to a time period of 25 µs per pulse. These pulses reflect
    off of the nearest object in front of the sensor, and return to it. The
    time between sending and receiving of the pulse packet is used to estimate
    the distance. If the reflecting object is either too far away or absorbs
    sound, less than eight pulses may be received, and this can cause a
    measurement error of 25 µs which corresponds to 8 mm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    device : :class:`SerialHandler`
        Serial connection to PSLab device.
    trig : str, optional
        Name of the trigger pin. Defaults to SQ1.
    echo : str, optional
        Name of the echo pin. Defaults to LA1.

    Example
    -------
    In this example the sensor's Vcc pin is connected to the PSLab's PV1 pin,
    the Trig pin is connected to SQ1, Echo to LA1, and Gnd to GND.
